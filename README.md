This is a repository specifically created for my project around the data exploration for COVID-19.

Tools used in this project were Excel, SQL, and Tableau. 
I first cleaned the data in excel and transferred the data to SQL. 

After, I explored the data in SQL by comparing the deaths/vaccinations that have happened since the start of 2020 until the end and closely focusing on that. 
Created views then transferred the data to Tableau to visualize our findings.
