This is a repository specifically created for my project around the data exploration for COVID-19. USed a variety of tools to extract insights and tell a compelling story with data.

Tools used in this project were Excel, SQL, and Tableau.
I first cleaned and manipulated the dataset in Excel, using formulas and functions to calculate averages and more. I then transferred the data to SQL.
In SQL, I used the cleaned dataset from Excel to join tables, using that to make comparisons between the deaths/vaccinations produced from COVID, and created more complex queries.  
Created views to look closely on which insights seemed more significant, then transferred the data to Tableau to visualize our findings.
